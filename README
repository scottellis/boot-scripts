Some u-boot command scripts for booting mostly Overo Tide and Beagleboard-xM 
boards. These boards don't have NAND to save u-boot customizations so a boot.scr
file is used for this. The behaviour to look for a boot.scr file is built into
the default Overo and Beagleboard bootloaders.

tide-mmc-boot - Overo Tide, simple MMC boot, no video, 720 MHz

tide-nfs-boot - Overo Tide, simple NFS boot, no video, 720 MHz, the IP addresses
	should be customized. 

	If you are using an older expansion board without an EEPROM storing the
	ethernet MAC, you will have to add a

	setenv ethaddr xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx 

	line to the command script. You can get a valid ethaddr by booting the
	tide-mmc-boot first and then checking the ethaddr that the Linux driver
	uses.


I'll add the xM scripts after some more testing.


make-boot-script.sh - Generates a boot.scr file that the OMAP3 bootloaders look
	for.


An alternative to this boot.scr stuff, is to modify the u-boot source code
directly with your customizations.

<u-boot-src>/include/configs/omap3_overo.h 
or 
<u-boot-src>/include/configs/omap3_beagle.h 


This will speed your boot times a little.
